\chapter{\commonlisp{} mode}

\commonlisp{} mode is still work in progress.  The contents of this
chapter can be seen as reflecting the plans we have for the final
version.  Details may change as a result of experience, of course.

\commonlisp{} mode consists of two parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{code analyzer}, which is responsible for analyzing
  the contents of the buffer and presenting the result of this
  analysis to the user.
\item A set of \emph{commands} that take advantage of the result if
  the analysis. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Code analyzer}

\subsection{Display of information from code analysis}

Information derived by the code analyzer is presented as slight
alterations of how the code elements in the buffer is displayed to the
user.  The following methods are used (roughly in decreasing order of
frequency):

\begin{itemize}
\item Changing the background color.
\item Changing the foreground color.
\item Changing the font face.
\item Using a different glyph.
\end{itemize}

In addition, a code element that is marked in this way also has
associated textual information that can be read in the minibuffer when
the cursor is positioned on the text, or as a tooltip when the pointer
is positioned above the text.  In the remainder of this chapter, we
give the English version of the textual information.
Internationalization may change the language according to user
preference.

Names of specific colors that are mentioned in this section are merely
\emph{examples}.  They may or may not be the default colors actually
used, and every color can be customized by the end user. 

Furthermore, in some cases a code element that is marked this way has
a \emph{context menu} associated with it.

In general, errors and warnings are indicated by a specific
\emph{background color}.  Typically these colors are in shades of
\emph{red}. 

Symbols that have no error or warning information associated with them
are displayed using some dark foreground color so as to give good
contrast with the background.  

Except for symbol with lexical bindings and symbols used for
\texttt{loop} keywords, the \emph{hue} of the color is associated with
the \emph{home package} of the symbol.  We use \emph{blue} for the
\commonlisp{} package, \emph{green} for the current package, and
\emph{magenta} for other packages.

Symbols with lexical bindings use \emph{cyan} colors, independently of
the home package of the symbol.  Symbols used as \texttt{loop}
keywords use a dark brown color. 

Within a family of similar hues, the darkest color is used for symbols
used as \emph{functions} and for symbols used as \emph{global
  variables}  The two categories can be distinguished because of the
\emph{position} within an expression.  Slightly lighter colors are
used for \emph{macros} and \emph{symbol macros}.  

A \emph{context menu} may be associated with certain symbols.

\subsection{Analyzer phases}

The code analyzer works in three phases.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Surface syntax analysis.
\item Structure syntax analysis.
\item Semantic analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Surface syntax analysis}

This phase consists of repeated applying a custom version of the
\commonlisp{} \texttt{read} function to the contents of the buffer in
order to obtain a \emph{succession of top-level expressions}.

The following types of errors are detected during this phase:

\begin{itemize}
\item Invalid tokens.  An invalid token is either a token that has an
  invalid constellation of package markers, or a token with an invalid
  constellation of escape characters.  In the latter case, it could be
  a \emph{single escape} character at the very end of the buffer (not
  even followed by a newline) or an odd number of \emph{multiple
    escape} characters.
\item A right parenthesis at the top level of the buffer.
\item An \emph{incomplete} expression, i.e., an expression that is not
  terminated, typically as a result of too few closing parentheses.
\item Extraneous whitespace. 
\end{itemize}

As mentioned previously, the result of this analysis is a succession
of top-level expressions, where the last one may incomplete.  An
incomplete expression is nevertheless parsed in order to determine the
presence of invalid tokens.  

\subsubsection{Invalid token syntax}

A token which does not have any interpretation as a number is
considered a potential symbol.  If so, there are a few cases where
token is nevertheless invalid as the name of a symbol.

The token might have an invalid constellation of package markers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Too many package markers.
\item Two package markers that are separated by some other character. 
\item A package marker at the end of the token.
\end{itemize}

In this case, the background color of the package markers is vivid
red, and the background of the symbol itself is pink. 

The associated textual information says ``Illegal constellation of
package markers''. 

\refFig{fig-invalid-package-markers} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-invalid-package-markers.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-invalid-package-markers}
Display of potential symbol with illegal package markers.}
\end{figure}

A token with a \emph{single escape} character immediately at the end
of the buffer is displayed with a \emph{pink} background.  The single
escape character itself has a vivid \emph{red} background.  The
tooltip says ``Single escape followed by end of buffer''.

A token with an odd number of \emph{multiple escape} characters is
displayed with a \emph{pink} background from the start of the token up
to the character immediately preceding the last multiple escape
character.  The last multiple escape character and the characters
following it are displayed with a vivid \emph{red} background.  The
tooltip says ``Odd number of multiple escape characters''.

No context menu is suggested for tokens with invalid syntax.

\subsubsection{Incomplete expression}

An incomplete expression is an expression that starts at some point in
the buffer, but the end of the buffer is reached before the expression
is complete.

Information about an incomplete expression is shown as an orange
background of the first character of the expression.  When several
nested expressions are incomplete, the first character of each nested
expression is marked this way.

\refFig{fig-incomplete-expression} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-incomplete-expression.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-incomplete-expression}
Display of incomplete expression.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Extraneous whitespace}

Whitespace is considered \emph{extraneous} in the following cases: 

\begin{itemize}
\item When it follows a left parenthesis.
\item When it precedes a right parenthesis.
\item When it follows other whitespace that separate two expressions. 
\item When it follows the last non-whitespace character of a line.
\end{itemize}

It is \emph{not} considered extraneous in the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item When it precedes the first non-whitespace character on a line. 
\item When it separates the first semicolon on a line from the last
  preceding non-whitespace character. 
\end{itemize}

Extraneous whitespace is marked with a \emph{pink} background.  The
tooltip associated with the marked background says ``Extraneous
whitespace''. 

\refFig{fig-extraneous-whitespace} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-extraneous-whitespace.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-extraneous-whitespace}
Display of extraneous whitespace.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Structure syntax analysis}

A top-level expression that passes the first phase of the code
analyzer is then analyzed as a \emph{form} with respect to its
\emph{structure syntax}.

This phase checks the form as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the form has the syntax of a symbol with one or two package
  markers (other than when the form has the syntax of a \emph{keyword}
  symbol), then a check is made that the package exists. 
\item If the form has the syntax of a symbol with a single package
  marker (other than when the package marker is the first character),
  then a check is made that the symbol exists in the package
  indicated, and that it is exported from that package.
\item If the form has the syntax of a symbol with two package markers,
  then a check is also made that the symbol exists in the package
  indicated, but with a less severe error display if it does not
  exist.
\item If the form is a compound form where the \texttt{car} is not a
  symbol, a check is made that the \texttt{car} of the form is a
  plausible \texttt{lambda} expression.
\item If form is a compound form, and the \texttt{car} of the compound
  form is a \emph{special operator} or a \emph{standard macro}, then
  the \emph{structure syntax} is verified.  For example, it is
  verified that the bindings of a \texttt{let} have the right form,
  and that \texttt{setf} has an even number of arguments. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-existing package}

A symbol with one or two package markers but where the package
indicated in the prefix does not exists is marked with a pink
background, and the package name is marked with a vivid red
background. 

The associated textual information says ``Non-existing package''.

\refFig{fig-non-existing-package} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-non-existing-package.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-non-existing-package}
Display of potential symbol with a non-existing package.}
\end{figure}

The context menu has a single option: ``Create the package''.

\subsubsection{Non-existing symbol}

A symbol token with a single package marker that refers to a
non-existing symbol is marked with a vivid red background under the
symbol name and a pink background under the package name.  The
associated textual information says ``Non-existing symbol''.

\refFig{fig-non-existing-symbol} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-non-existing-symbol.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-non-existing-symbol}
Display of a non-existing symbol with one package marker.}
\end{figure}

The context menu gives the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create and export the symbol in the specified package.
\item Import the symbol from a different package into the specified
  package, and also export it from the specified package.  The user
  will be prompted for the package to import from.
\end{itemize}

A symbol token with a two package markers that refers to a
non-existing symbol is marked with a pink background.  The
associated textual information says ``Non-existing symbol''.  

\refFig{fig-non-existing-symbol-two-package-markers} illustrates how
this type of information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-non-existing-symbol-two-package-markers.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-non-existing-symbol-two-package-markers}
Display of a non-existing symbol with two package markers.}
\end{figure}

The context menu gives the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create the symbol in the specified package.
\item Import the symbol from a different package into the specified
  package.  The user will be prompted for the package to import from.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Unexported symbol}

A symbol token with a single package marker that refers to an
existing, but unexported symbol is marked with a pink background.  The
associated textual information says ``Unexported symbol.

\refFig{fig-unexported-symbol} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-unexported-symbol.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-unexported-symbol}
Display of an unexported symbol.}
\end{figure}

The context menu gives the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item Export the symbol from the specified package.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semantic analysis}

Only when a top-level form passes the second phase of the analysis is
it subject to \emph{semantic analysis}.  

\subsubsection{Illegal use of \commonlisp{} symbols}

When a symbol from the \texttt{common-lisp} package is used in a
context that can be determined illegal, it is signaled by the use of
an orange background.

\refFig{fig-illegal-use-of-cl-symbol} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-illegal-use-of-cl-symbol.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-illegal-use-of-cl-symbol}
Display of illegal use of \commonlisp{} symbol.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Names of lexical functions}

Names of functions introduced by \texttt{flet} or \texttt{labels} are
shown with a dark \emph{cyan} foreground color, independently of the
home package of the symbol including when that package happens to be
the \texttt{common-lisp} package.

When the pointer is located over such a name, the corresponding symbol
in the introducing binding is highlighted with a light blue
background. 

One entry in the context menu is to jump to location where the binding
was established. 

\subsubsection{Names of lexical variables}

Names of lexical variables introduced by \texttt{let}, \texttt{let*},
\texttt{multiple-value-bind}, and by macros that expand into one of
these special forms are shown with a dark \emph{cyan}
foreground color, independently of the home package of the symbol
including when that package happens to be the \texttt{common-lisp}
package.

in the introducing binding is highlighted with a light blue
background. 

One entry in the context menu is to jump to location where the binding
was established. 

\subsubsection{Names of local macros}

Names of local macros are shown with a slightly lighter \emph{cyan}
foreground color, independently of the home package of the symbol
including when that package happens to be the \texttt{common-lisp}
package.

in the introducing binding is highlighted with a light blue
background. 

One entry in the context menu is to jump to location where the binding
was established. 

\subsubsection{Names of local symbol macros}

in the introducing binding is highlighted with a light blue
background. 

One entry in the context menu is to jump to location where the binding
was established. 

\subsubsection{Names of global functions in the current package}

\subsubsection{Names of constant variables in other packages}

\subsubsection{Argument mismatch}

Argument mismatch is a situation that may occur for the following
types of forms:

\begin{itemize}
\item Function calls.
\item Macro calls.
\item Special forms.
\end{itemize}

Argument mismatch corresponds to one of the following situations:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of arguments is less than the minimum number required
  by the function, the macro, or the special operator.
\item The number of arguments is greater than the maximum number
  allowed by the function, the macro, or the special operator.
\item The function, the macro or the special operator admit \&key
  arguments, and there is an odd number of arguments in that part of
  the argument list.
\item The function, the macro or the special operator requires the
  number of arguments to be even, but an odd number of arguments are
  given (e.g., for \texttt{setq} and \texttt{setf}).
\item The function, the macro or the special operator requires the
  number of arguments to be odd, but an even number of arguments are
  given.
\end{itemize}

In the case where the number of arguments is greater than the maximum
number allowed, each extraneous arguments is highlighted with a vivid
\emph{red} background.  The tooltip associated with each arguments
says ``Extraneous argument.'' 

In all other cases, the closing parenthesis is preceded by a
\emph{red} rectangle.  Notice that this red rectangle does not
constitute an item in the buffer, and as a consequence it is
impossible to position the cursor between the red rectangle and the
closing parenthesis.  Rather, the red rectangle is part of the way the
closing parenthesis is displayed.  In the case where too few arguments
were given, the tooltip says ``Too few arguments'', and in the other
cases it says ``Wrong argument parity''.

\subsubsection{Indentation}

A line that is indented incorrectly is displayed with a \emph{pink}
arrow in the left margin.  If the indentation of the line is
insufficient, the arrow points to the right, and if the indentation of
the line is excessive, then the arrow points to the left.

\refFig{fig-wrong-indentation} illustrates how this type of
information is displayed.

\subsection{Other analyses}

\subsubsection{Comments}

Comments can be checked for spelling errors. 

\section{Commands}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Forward expression} (C-M-f).  If the cursor is
  positioned between two expressions, then it will be moved so that it
  is positioned immediately after the expression to the right.  If the
  cursor is inside an atomic expression, then it will be moved so that
  is is positioned immediately after that atomic expression.  Notice
  that comments count as expressions for this command.  If the cursor
  is not positioned inside an atomic expression, and there is no
  expression immediately after it, an error will be displayed in the
  minibuffer.
\item \texttt{Backward expression} (C-M-b).  If the cursor is
  positioned between two expressions, then it will be moved so that it
  is positioned immediately before the expression to the left.  If the
  cursor is inside an atomic expression, then it will be moved so that
  is is positioned immediately before that atomic expression.  Notice
  that comments count as expressions for this command.  If the cursor
  is not positioned inside an atomic expression, and there is no
  expression immediately before it, an error will be displayed in the
  minibuffer.
\item \texttt{Beginning of top-level expression}
\item \texttt{End of top-level expression}
\item \texttt{Exchange expressions}
\item \texttt{Up expression}
\item \texttt{Down expression}
\item \texttt{Indent line}
\item \texttt{Indent region}
\item \texttt{Indent top-level expression}
\item \texttt{Indent buffer}
\item \texttt{Complete symbol}
\end{itemize}
