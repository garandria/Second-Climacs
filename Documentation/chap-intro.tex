\sysname{} is an \emacs{}-like editor written entirely in
\commonlisp{}.  It is called \sysname{} because it is a complete
rewrite of the \climacs{} text editor.

\climacs{} gave us some significant experience with writing a text
editor, and we think we can improve on a number of aspects of it.  As
a result, there are some major differences between \climacs{} and
\sysname{}:

\begin{itemize}
\item We implemented a better buffer representation, and extracted it
  from the editor code into a separate library named \cluffer{}.  The
  new buffer representation will have better performance, especially
  on large buffers, and it will make it easier to write sophisticated
  parsers for buffer contents.
\item The incremental parser for \commonlisp{} syntax of \climacs{} is
  very hard to maintain, and while it is better than that of \emacs{},
  it is still not good enough.  \sysname{} uses \eclector{} in order
  to parse buffer contents.  \eclector{} is a library that implements
  the \commonlisp{} reader, but that can also be customized in many
  ways.  We take advantage of these capabilities to read material that
  is normally skipped, like comments, and for error recovery.  By
  using a \commonlisp{} reader, we parse the buffer contents in the
  same way that the \commonlisp{} compiler would.
\item \climacs{} depends on \mcclim{} for its graphic user interface.
  \sysname{} is independent of any particular library for making
  graphic user interfaces, allowing it to be configured with different
  such libraries.
\end{itemize}
