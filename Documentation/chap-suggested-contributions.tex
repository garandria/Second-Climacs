\section{What not to work on}

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple windows.  We think multiple windows should be handled
  at the level of \mcclim{}.
\item Magit clone.  Magit is an Emacs contribution for managing GIT
  from Emacs.  We think that \sysname{} is not the right place for an
  interface to GIT, which we think instead should be created as a
  separate \clim{} application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Spell checker}

This task consists of integrating an existing spell checker%
\footnote{https://github.com/robert-strandh/Spell}
into \sysname{}.  The parser for \commonlisp{} comments should consult
the spell checker, and indicate incorrectly spelled words with some
graphical hint such as color.
