\section{What not to work on}

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple windows.  We think multiple windows should be handled
  at the level of \mcclim{}.
\item Magit clone.  Magit is an Emacs contribution for managing GIT
  from Emacs.  We think that \sysname{} is not the right place for an
  interface to GIT, which we think instead should be created as a
  separate \clim{} application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Grammar checker}

An existing spell checker library%
\footnote{https://github.com/robert-strandh/Spell} can return
information about part of speach.  This information can be used as a
basis for a grammar checker than can then be used to check the grammar
of comments and documentation strings.
