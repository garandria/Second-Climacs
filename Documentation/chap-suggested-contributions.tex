\section{What not to work on}

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple windows.  We think multiple windows should be handled
  at the level of \mcclim{}.
\item Magit clone.  Magit is an Emacs contribution for managing GIT
  from Emacs.  We think that \sysname{} is not the right place for an
  interface to GIT, which we think instead should be created as a
  separate \clim{} application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Spell checker}

A spell checker is not directly part of \sysname{} but it is a very
valuable tool to have.  It should be created as a separate library
with well defined protocols so that it can be used on the contents of
a \sysname{} buffer, or part of one.

In order to prepare for the use in a grammar checker, it might be
desirable to have words stored with additional attributes such as
singular/plural form, verb tense, part of speech, etc.
