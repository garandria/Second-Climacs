;;; The CLIM II specification requires the position of an output
;;; record to be relative to the stream in which it is located, rather
;;; than to its parent.  We interpret that to mean that the following
;;; generic functions accept or return stream-relative coordinates:
;;;
;;;  - output-record-position
;;;  - (setf* output-record-position)
;;;  - output-record-start-cursor-position
;;;  - (setf* output-record-start-cursor-position)
;;;  - output-record-end-cursor-position
;;;  - (setf* output-record-end-cursor-position)
;;;  - replay-output-record
;;;  - output-record-hit-detection-rectangle*
;;;  - output-record-refined-position-test
;;;
;;; Clearly, we do not want to store stream-relative positions in the
;;; output records for individual lines, because then we would have to
;;; update all following such records when one is inserted or deleted.
;;; We get around this problem by requiring that the kind of child
;;; output records that can be contained in this top-level record be
;;; subclasses of RELATIVE-COORDINATES-OUTPUT-RECORD-MIXIN.
;;;
;;; In order for this scheme to work, we have to rely on CLIM not
;;; caching the position of our relative output records, because those
;;; positions may change as a result of editing operations, and
;;; without (SETF* OUTPUT-RECORD-POSITION) being called.

;;; We make this class a MIXIN class so that it can be used to define
;;; subclasses of existing CLIM output record classes such as
;;; TEXT-OUTPUT-RECORD, thereby overriding the default behavior of the
;;; parent class.
